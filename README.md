This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). This project helped me practice responsive layouts, semantic HTML, and modern CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the social links profile card on desktop and mobile devices.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Inter](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap) font from Google Fonts
- COLORS:  Green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%)
           White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
           Grey 700: hsl(0, 0%, 20%)
           Grey 800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%)
           Grey 900: hsl(0, 0%, 8%)


### What I learned

- How to use Flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally
- How to create a responsive card layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- How to use CSS variables and follow a style guide for consistent design
- How to implement accessible hover and focus states for links


```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

- I hope to have better understanding and complex uses of flexbox and grids
- To understand better how to implement media queries to fit into any screen size and devices
-Use CSS transitions and animations for more complex layouts
